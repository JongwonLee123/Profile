# Profile
In this project, I created a portfolio. 
First I created a nav bar that allows the user to travel to about me, works, and contacts quicker.
If user hovers over nav bar elements, they get highlighted and text turns black.
I incorporated a fun text choice where if the user hovers over the "Hello there", it would show "Welcome to My Portfolio"
I utilized flex elements, so the website resizes as the screen decreases.
I incorporated module 1 challenge where if image is clicked, it sends to my website version of Horieson
I added href that allow user to phone, gmail, and visit github (When hovered, they get highlighted and text turns black.)
Finally, I added a footer 
I plan on adding more information and works as the program progresses.
